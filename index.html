        <h1>Human Respiratory System</h1>
    </header>
    <p>Humans, like other animals, need air to stay alive. 
    Air is a mixture of gases found in Earth's atmosphere. The respiratory system ensures that you have a steady supply of clean and filtered air that goes into the lungs. This consist of lungs and various breathing tubes that allow air to reach the lungs. The respiratory system allows gas exchange. 
    It brings oxygen to our body and expels carbon dioxide.</p>

        <h1>The respiratory tract is divided into two sections</h1>
    </header>
<ul>
    <li>Upper Respiratory Tract- This consists of the nostrils, nasal cavities, pharynx, and larynx.</li>
    <li> Lower Respiratory Tract- This is composed of the trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli.</li>
</ul>

    <h1>Parts of the Respiratory System</h1>
</header>
     <p>The respiratory system has many different parts that work together to help you breath.</p>
    <img src="img.hrs copy.jpg" alt="hrs" class="center">
<ul>   
    <li>Nostrils- When you breath air in through the nose, where it is filtered through the two openings called the Nostrils.</li>
    <li>Pharynx- Tube that delivers air from your mouth and nose to the trachea(windpipe).</li>
    <li>Trachea- Passage connecting your throat and lungs.</li>
    <li>Larynx- Hollow organ that allows you to talk and make sounds when air moves in and out.</li>
    <li>Bronchial Tubes- Tubes at the bottom of your windpipe that connects into each lungs. </li>
    <li>Lungs- Two organs that removes oxygen from the air and pass it into your blood.</li>
</ul>

    <h1>Infectious Diseases of the Respiratory System</h1>
</header>     
<ul>
    <li>Common Cold- This common cold is a contagious infection of the upper respiratory tract and is usually the result of a viral infection caused by the rhinovirus.</li>
    <li>Pneumonia- This refers to any infection of the lungs caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, or even protozoa in rare circumstances.</li>
    <li>Tuberculosis- Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which can spread through respiratory droplets by coughing, sneezing, or spitting phlegm.</li>
</ul>
